1.  Define the function of a constructor. [2]
The function of a constructor is to make a new object of a specific class.

2. Outline the advantages of polymorphism, using the RollingStock class as an example. [3]
Using polymorphism allows code from a superclass to be used in subclasses instead of having to be re-made every time a new
subclass is made. For example, by making Engine and Wagon subclasses of RollingStock, we can call the variable ID and the
constructor getWeight using the super() method instead of re-writing the code each time.

3. Construct a unified modelling language (UML) diagram of the Train class. [3]
*ATTACHED*

4. Construct a method getNumberOfWagons(), part of the Train class, that returns the
number of wagons currently coupled to the train. [2]
*CHECK THE CODE*

5. Construct the removeWagon() method that will remove one wagon from a train and
return the removed object. Include appropriate error checking. [5]
*CHECK THE CODE*

6. Outline one advantage of using standard library collections. [2]
Using standard library collections make it so that you don't have to code for something like an ArrayList every time you
want to use one.

7. Describe two ways in which programming by a team differs from programming by an individual working alone. [4]
In a team, there is a much higher chance that errors will be caught because there are more people looking over the code.
In terms of differences in the actual code, instance variables for different classes are often made private - only
accessible via getters and setters - so that the variables' names can be changed more easily.

8. The following code implements the Parcel class used in the delivery company’s program.

public class Parcel{
    private int trackingID;
    private double weight;
    public String destinationAddress;
    public String originAddress;
    public Parcel(int ID){
        trackingID = ID;
        weight = 0;
    }
    public void setWeight(double newWeight){
        weight=newWeight;
    }
    public double getWeight(){
        return weight;
    }
}

The origin and destination addresses are stored in a Parcel object as simple strings. However,
addresses are complex and there are a lot of different pieces of information that may or may not
be present such as a first name or a business name, in addition to house number, street name,
city and country. It has been decided to create a new Address class to handle this information.

State the appropriate data type to be used in the Address class to store
    (i) the street name; [1]
    String
    (ii) the building number; [1]
    int
    (iii) an indication of whether or not this is a business address. [1]
    String

*CHECK THE CODE*

9. Identify the changes to the Parcel class that will be needed to make use of the new
Address class. [3]
Change destinationAddress and originAddress from String to Address.

10. Outline how these two new classes can be created with minimal duplication of code. [3]
They don't have any duplicated code (not in my version, anyway).

11. Consider the following code fragment.

Train A=new Train(123);
Engine B=new Engine(7);
A.addEngine(B);
Wagon C=new Wagon(23);
A.addWagon(C);
Wagon D=new Wagon(66);
A.addWagon(D);
Wagon E=new Wagon(71);
A.addWagon(E);
A.addEngine(new Engine(9));

(i) Draw the mEngines array after the code fragment has been executed. [2]
[7, 9]

(ii) State the value of mEngineCount after the code fragment has been executed. [1]
2

(iii) Draw the mWagons array after both the code fragment above and the code fragment
below have been executed. [2]
    Wagon F=A.removeWagon();
    F=A.removeWagon();
    A.addWagon(new Wagon(214));
[23, 66, 214]

12. The parcels loaded into a wagon cannot weigh more than the capacity of the wagon. A train’s
engines must have enough combined power to pull the loaded wagons. The company needs to
be able to check that these requirements are being met.

Construct the getWeight() method in the Wagon class that returns the total combined
weight of the parcels currently in the wagon and the wagon itself. [4]
*CHECK THE CODE*

13. Construct the getWeight() method in the Train class that returns the total combined
weight of all the parcels, engines and wagons in a train. [4]
*CHECK THE CODE*

14. Explain why having a getWeight() method in both the Train and Wagon classes
does not cause a compiler error, even though the Train class does not inherit from the
RollingStock class. [2]
The two methods, despite having the same name, only apply to the class they were put into. As long as the type of object
on which they're being called is assigned, it will not cause an error.
